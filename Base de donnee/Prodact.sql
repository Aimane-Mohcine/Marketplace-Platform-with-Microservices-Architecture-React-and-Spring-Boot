If I wanted parallax for video then I''d go for the Cine. (Video on the non-Cine versions is "ok" - though nothing in the Mavic 3 series will approach ProRes RAW or CDNG with the Inspire 2/3 series) The 1" sensor with the Hasselblad glass makes it. The Air series is great, but with a fixed aperture, it doesn''t give the flexibility that the Mavic 3 series does. The airframe is the classic Mavic 3 with the associated flight time.

So they gave me a gift card because they didn''t have any in stock whenever I returned it so I went to their website and I bought another one. They were only $300 now but there was one for $270 that was refurbished so I took the chance and it was okay. And after flying it three times I crashed it again because even though it was a low battery, I knew it was going to be low and I was going to land it in front of me and I forgot that when it hits 10% it goes straight up in the air and starts going back to where it took off from but it could not go straight up in the air because there was a tree above it and so it flew up and hit the tree and it broke the arm on this one too... I did not have the extended warranty now but I just bought a $20 replacement arm on Amazon without the motors to repair it, which will void any warranty maybe? I''m going to try to reuse everything in it, it''s just one little broken section. I will add a picture to it and I think it''s better to spend $20 for a replacement plastic arm instead of $180 for extended warranty that once you use it you lose it. so I recommend this because it''s a really high quality drone but it does not Auto follow you but you don''t really need that anyway. just stay away from trees and power lines and whenever you take off be sure there''s nothing straight above you because it''s going to try to go straight up and then straight down in the same place and whenever it gets down to 15% battery. you better land immediately because if not it''s going to fly straight up and hit something on its own trying to get back home.

The reason behind my decision to upgrade stemmed from my desire for a watch with similar features, but with a notable improvement in screen quality. Opting for a different Garmin model over the Fenix, I found that it not only maintained the functionalities I relied on but also offered substantial updates, particularly in terms of a superior, lighter, and more compact screen.');

So many more features than this including maps and music, these are just the ones I like the most.

We spent a month looking at different makes and models and while we had budgeted to spend a little less on a new one, this unit quickly became the standard to which we compared the others, so we decided to pull the trigger and purchase it. Absolutely no buyers remorse here, this fridge is awesome! We love everything from the backlighting, to the storage space and the middle pull out drawer is fantastic! We had delivery and installation done by Best Buy and it was excellent! The only thing I would say that has underwhelmed me thus far is the water dispenser/ice maker. I love the autofill for the water, but the dispensing rate is somewhat slow. Also, the ice cube size is smaller than our previous refrigerator, and the dispenser tends to chop them some, even when its not on crushed ice mode.  Having said that, I would consider these items more of a knit pick than a major concern. At the end of the day, there is so much to love about this GE Profile Refrigerator, that it leads me to highly recommend it if you’re in the market for a new refrigerator.');

Ultimately chose this item due to the price more than the functionality of it. So the extra bells and whistles still getting used to. Few things that were inconsistent is the advertising description of the dryer was incorrect. It said there is no internal lighting when there is one. Also they try and get you to purchase the recommended installation equipment like the water hoses and 3 Way valve for the steam function and Samsung had already included that inside the dryer drum when it was delivered not sure if best buy is aware of that but think that should be made known. Also I think best buy had in the description that there''s a lint indicator to alert you when it needs to be cleaned and there is no option for this exact dryer. I could be wrong on that just going off memory which was 2 months ago. All in all it''s a great investment so far I love the innovation Samsung puts into their products and thankfully best buy was offering it at an irresistible price.');

There are some quirks to operation that you will only discover by reading the manual and using it as instructed, so I would strongly recommend not tossing the book in the trash. The air fryer function is very easy to use and I appreciate the “HOT!” warning the screen gives me when turning something being air fried. Make sure you are only using the high-rise platform when it is necessary. Most stuff you can air fry using the shorter one.

''Was planning on getting a Sony TV, but after the price drop this was too good to pass up and it allowed me to get the 5 year warranty and still come in at a couple hundred under the comparable Sony model. I''ve had a few clients get high end name brand TV''s (Sony, Samsung, LG - I''m looking at you), only to have them fail in a a year or two, so getting the extended warranty made sense to me. I do not regret the purchase decision. Setup with Google Home App was surprisingly straightforward. I quite like the picture it produces. The only thing that''s odd is the limited adjustability of Dolby Vision content. Not sure if that''s by design or unique to this brand/model. Either way, the picture (in Movie mode) is great out of the box, so there is little need to adjust it, once you dialed it in to your liking. I can''t comment on sound, as I run the sound thru the eARC to a Marantz receiver, which works flawlessly. Can''t comment on durability either, as I''ve only had it for a couple of months, but so far the TV and Google software have worked without a hitch. Two more things: 1) the TV does get pretty bright, if that''s something you''re after and 2) the Glass does not have anti-reflective coating. If you set it up in a room where reflections might be an issue you might want to spend a little more to get a TV that has better coating. Otherwise, this is solid, especially given the price.');

This TV uses the same processor as the the TCL flagship QM8. For you non tuners it looked great out of the box, once I turned off the Low Power Mode that most all TV''s today are shipped in. Setup was a breeze but it takes a good 10 minutes or so to download and install current software updates depending on your internet connectivity. The Google TV setup is breeze using your phone, tablet, laptop or PC. The Google interface locks in and switches your Apps fast and works like a charm. The TV has an excellent wide range of tuning features. Bright saturated colors, deep blacks with a minimal amount of blooming. Netflix HDR+ blew me away! The sound quality is decent but I had the TV routed through a high end Dolby Atmos 9.1 sound system. After doing a months worth of research watching the top experts on YouTube and reading countless reviews. I would say that this is the best value for dollar to picture and feature ratio on today''s TV market. Easily as good if not better in some areas as Samsung, LG and Sony. The Bad: I lost the so called "Panel Lottery" as the TV developed a red line from the top to the bottom and a white, red and blue line from side to side across the screen in 4 days of minimal usage. Sadly I had to return it to Best Buy. I liked the TV enough to try it again and so I ordered another, hoping I win this round on the "Panel Lottery.

This TV has a lot of features that you might not find on a similarly priced budget TV; like Dolby HDR and HDR10 (for enhanced picture quality) and Atmos (for enhanced audio quality). It also features an abundance of connectors, including (but not limited to): HDMI 2.1 (3), USB 2.0 (2) and digital optical.  It even has a headphone jack and an ethernet port in case you can''t or don''t want to use Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.  According to Best Buy, the TV I purchased is a newer version of the 55” C350 Series (Model Number 55C350LU); it became available in late May of 2023.  Don''t really know what the difference is from the older 2021 version (Model Number 55C350KU).  According to the online product descriptions, mine seems to have one less HDMI port (3 vs. 4), but all are now the more advanced HDMI 2.1 ports (3 vs. 1).  Whatever the differences are, I’m guessing they’re relatively minor.  (BTW, at the time of this writing, the posted Best Buy photo showing the back of this TV may not be accurate; the back of my TV looks exactly like the photo posted for the 2021 model, and yes, my TV has a label with the 2023 model number.)  My only small complaint is that the VESA mounts for this TV are 200 mm X 300 mm, which to me seems a little unusual.  (Again, the posted picture does not accurately show the position of the VESA mounts.)  The horizontal measurement being only 200 mm and narrower than the vertical meant that none of the mounting patterns offered by my existing "universal" mount fits this TV.  That''s another "no big deal" if you''re using the provided stand/feet and not wall mounting.  Picture quality seems fine to me.  Is the quality as good as a similar-sized "QLED" or "OLED" TV that costs 3-5X as much or more?  Who knows?...probably not...but the only way I''d know for sure would be to compare them next to each other at home in the same room.

I would have to say that this system is fantastic. Using the TV speakers in conjunction with all the other soundbar and rear speakers. I had a Bose  series 7 soundbar with my old tv. It sounded good by not this good.');

The slim design and easy setup are a big plus and the 65 inch QLED picture is amazingly clear.
